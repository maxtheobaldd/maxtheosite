# **Good Evening,**

So, the bell### of a Politician we all know and love, made the bright choice to put his position as an MP on the line to fly to Australia to eat Camel Penis and god knows what else to seem like "more of a human". At least he recognises that most politicians aren't even human in the first place. 

As usual with the Tories, this was a decision made by Matt to line his own pocket after he, let me make this clear... Broke his own COVID-19 lockdown rules HE set in place by *cheating on his wife with a co-worker*, which was leaked by The Sun last year. 

Rumours are circulating that he was offered ~Â£125,000 for his time on the show, Like he even needs the money in the first place! But hey, At least we all get to laugh as him eating camel penis and sit in a box with snakes crawling up him.
The fact that he's said he's doing this to "appear more human" though is actually laughable. I mean, does he really think people are going to ignore the fact he Left the COVID lockdown till the last minute and cheating on his wife? No, they aren't. Matt, we still think you're tory scum weather you like it or not pal. ðŸ˜‚
